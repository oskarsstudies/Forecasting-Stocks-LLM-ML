2023-03-28,AAPL,"Strategically speaking, this is smart and ""chump change"".  Apple is one of the few companies with the cash flow to build a streaming business from scratch.

So far, they've been doing a pretty excellent job at it.  Apple TV reminds me of how HBO used to be decades ago.  Very high quality content.  Not a lot of it, but what's there is high quality. 

Now if they can increase the QUANTITY of that high quality, things get interesting and it would be a differentiator from the ""spray and pray"" content at some others.",163,Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,8.0
2023-03-28,AAPL,"I think content creation is really there to add value to their products. 

Netflix has 31.6bn revenue and Apple has 394.3bn revenue.

Chasing the competitive streaming dollars is such a poor use of cash. But driving more product sales and bringing people into the Apple ecosystem is far more profitable.

Netflix would rather sell $1000 devices every 2 years than collecting $7 per month that can be shared by multiple people and cancelled anytime.",109,Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,8.0

I don't really see it as a good or bad thing, I believe there isn't a nominal amount where if the company goes past certain PE ratio they are doomed. But PE ratio is more of when I take a first glance at a company, perhaps earnings is something I should pay attention to especially if I have a high PE ratio but I'm not in the tech industry vice versa.

But, I used to be quite fixated at looking at ratios too when I first started off investing my salary.

2024-03-04,AMZN,"This is a great dd, however, i disagree with the conclusion. 

Historically Amazon has spared no expense and reinvested all cashflow in growth.  This is why it maintains such a high pe ratio, people expect it to grow.  But the penny pinching you described has become prevalent.  Why is this a new focus for amazon? Because Jassy has no tricks left in the hat.  Amazon has no more s curve ideas.  So Jassy is racing the lower the P/E ratio because he knows that once the market realizes amazon is not much different from Walmart with a cloud business the valuation will change to match.  

Historically Amazon has massively benefited from first mover advantage and has only dominated in spaces where they started with a strong head start.  (Online retail, alexa, cloud). However they fail massively in spaces where they dont have a lead. (Fire phone, amazon wallet, and a thousand more).  But amazon just missed the boat big time on ai, this should have been the next s curve. Amazon was poised for it.  They have massive amounts of data, engineering talent, and money.  They just flopped.  Imo they have lost their spark, Jassy is not the right guy to lead the business and amazon is entering its balmer era.

2024-03-21,AMZN,"Amazing write up, but you’re missing a MASSIVE key point in AWS, which you wouldn’t know unless you’ve worked with it. Ask anyone who works in massive corporations that use a cloud based infrastructure to meet their needs; AWS is KING. They basically “run the internet”, or a better statement is, “the internet runs on AWS”. If you’re lucky enought to know people who have had the luxury of using Google Cloud and Azure, as well as AWS, they will tell you that AWS is miles ahead of anyone. Massive companies don’t just “switch over” if they’re unhappy or looking for something different, either. Which basically means AWS’s market share will only keep growing. Have you seen their financials? It’s so incredible that there’s was rumours that they might “split” and have like 2 companies in 1. They generated 91 billion dollars in 2023 alone and it’s only going to continue to grow. In contrast, if im not mistaken, Azure “only” made 24 billion. Amazon is literally another 70 billion ahead for the year in revenue. With the expected growth of cloud computing and infrastructure, they’re poised for a MASSIVE jump in revenue (over 200 billion+ per year) in the next decade-ish. I remember reading that there’s a possibility for over 300 billion in revenue in the next decade. Of course, like yours, these are all projections, but the numbers are there. 

Again, you did A LOT of work on your analysis, no doubt! But quite possibly their biggest proponent to send AMZN to the stratosphere, your points were slightly “weak and short”.

All suppliers are having an inventory glut.  They can’t give away parts in some cases.  ST is not utilizing all their expansion efforts with some sitting idle.  Allocation has really decreased and only a few suppliers are still having issues such as Melexis and Vishay FETs.  I am not saying ST isn’t a good company but right now semis are tough and I don’t see ST as a tech leader.  The best suppliers I work with are Monolithic Power, ON and NXP.  So I own them. Just avoid Microchip, they are a cluster fuck at every turn.",40,STMicroelectronics (STM) is one of the best and most undervalued European stocks,3.0
2023-12-03,ASML,"So what’s the difference to Infineon for example? European tech stocks are usually valued worse than their American equivalent. 
I take it as an advantage that they aren’t as rich as the American stocks. But STM has an abysmal market share compared to others, but I would say they still have a bright future a head of them. Especially with the EU subsidising everything related to microchips.",32,STMicroelectronics (STM) is one of the best and most undervalued European stocks,7.0
2023-12-03,ASML,"Well that's why I'm highlighting the fact it is mispriced imo. STM has more revenue, better margins, more net income than Infineon. Yet Infineon is currently trading at 15PE, with 47bn market cap on the DAX whereas STM is trading at 9 PE and 39bn market cap. To me it doesn't make sense at all. I think STM has been severely mispriced in recent years, and it continues today even when compared to its direct competitors.

I don't know about your point regarding market share I'll confess, I thought they were doing pretty good and gaining market share recently actually in several areas. I'll see if I can dig up the source.",22,STMicroelectronics (STM) is one of the best and most undervalued European stocks,8.0
2023-12-03,ASML,"I don’t sell semiconductor but I design with them for a living and NXP processors are not designer/developer friendly.

Way more efficient for power sensitive IoT applications and doesn’t have any unnecessary crap. Fuck NXP.

Edit: OP this guy is a distributor, bigger companies with volume rarely go through a distributor like arrow, mouser, Digikey etc. we directly deal with the manufacturer. We directly bought processors from NXP before and now we directly buy the millions of processors from STmicro. We get reached out by distributors all the time looking for business, we mostly turn them down.

2023-12-03,ASML,"Automotive is definitely in a slump right now.  Automotive is usually the last to see it.  So consumer sees it first then it trickles down to automotive.  In our industry as as whole we see this lasting until Q3 sometime.  This has to do with a lot of things from higher interest rates to inventory surplus.   I have been doing the same thing for 20 years and I am seeing more cancellations now than just about anytime during my tenure, 2008 was a mess though.  I think growth will slow for all semis. Q4 numbers should be telling.  
My viewpoint is mainly from an automotive view. By no means is ST a bad company, my opinion is they don’t have a technological edge.  Their micros are lacking especially in the ARM space. No real AECQ (automotive qualification) offerings.  Their other highest runner is high side drivers.  Their new family which is M09 technology has been extremely slow to rollout. It’s behind Infineon, that makes it easier to design in future products if your improved product comes out first.  
A lot of companies grew quickly after  Covid.  It was like someone pushed the On button and immediately suppliers were shipping 100% and beyond capacity.  Leadtimes grew aggressively.  I was quoting Diodes Inc parts at 104 weeks.  
Now it’s like someone hit the Off button. Lead times are back to normal and I am holding a lot of inventory which will slow all suppliers. 
All large suppliers, ST included, will do better because cars have more and more semi content. When demand does kick back in ST may be positioned to do well because of added capacity.   

I am in the largest automotive market in the world. I can only tell you what I see.  I see better opportunities with other suppliers but I think semis in general is a good place to be going forward.  I don’t think ST will do poorly but from my standpoint I see better options.  That’s all.",8,STMicroelectronics (STM) is one of the best and most undervalued European stocks,4.0

2024-01-01,ASML,"Happy new year!   Nice research.  You put in the effort.  I applaud that.  Allow me to give you the perspective of an old IT industry pro. 

That company was the leader 50 years ago and there was no one else for decades.  AMD started by making cheap clones but were ignored by Intel like a flea on an elephant.  For decades they were just printing money.  Intel was “inside” everything.  They just fell asleep at the wheel.  Sorry but you just don’t come back from that.  Dozens of other companies from that era missed the boat and they are either gone or a shadow of themselves.   

IBM used to be #1 for decades.  Biggest company in the world.  Now a shadow.  DEC was #2 computer company for decades and used to make the most innovative chips and systems in the world.  Many still in use.  Gone.  Purchased by an IBM PC clone maker by the name of Compaq.  Gone.   Purchased by HP.  Now a shadow of themselves. I can speak with some knowledge on the subject as I worked for both DEC and IBM for more years than I want to remember. Yes. Jurassic park here. 

So answer me. Is GM or Ford going to be the leader in EVs and beat Tesla?   Is Yahoo is going to take back the search crown from google?  Is Lotus 123 going to take back dominance in spreadsheets from Microsoft?  If not why would anyone bet on a relic like Intel being in the same league as Nvidia or AMD let alone be the future of chips.  They are the past.  40 years ago…great idea……2024….not so much.  

Some things get better with age.  Wine.  Buildings.  Books.  Art.  Cities.  But chip firms aren’t one of them.  Technology cycles are getting shorter and shorter.  The next Nvidia and AMD is out there.  Go forth and find it young one.  When you do please do me a favor and don’t tell me because I’m just too darn old.

They are a duopoly that control 90%+ of the market in the thing they do that is absolutely required by the semiconductor industry.  Buying similar companies that dominate a niche means you mostly just care about the niche, and don't have to worry that AMD passes NVDA someday or SNPS takes 80% of their niche.  You'll do fine either way.

Likewise, AMAT, ASML, KLAC, LRCX are the main semiconductor equipment companies.  Owning these four is basically a longterm sure thing until some other company comes along and threatens the stranglehold these four have on their niche.

This will be the new deliverable per contract after the merger is done.  The deliverable for adjusted VMW options will be BASED ON THE MERGER CONSIDERATION WHICH ACCRUES TO NON-ELECTING VMW SHAREHOLDERS (stated in terms of a current 100-Share deliverable). 100 x Non-Electing Consideration 

People can elect to take .252 broadcom(currently valued at about $210.54, or $142.50 in cash. And broadcom is only paying 50% cash, 50% shares, so if too many people choose one or the other then it will be prorated. And obviously people will choose the shares so the default non electing consideration will almost 100% be the $142.50 cash and that will be the new deliverable instead of 100 shares.

So this will be the details of the box spread

140 short call - Obligation to deliver $142.50 and receive $140 = $2.50 debit

140 long put - Right to deliver $142.50 and receive $140, not in the money so you won't exercise that.

160 long call - Right to spend $160 to receive $142.50, not in the money so you won't exercise that

160 short put - Obligation to deliver $160 and receive $142.50 - $17.50 debit

You got $30.25 credit and the total debit was $20 so you should have a guaranteed gain of $10.25. But this seems too good to be true and I'm still trying to figure out wtf is going on.

The only thing I can think of at this point for the strange prices is a large dividend before expiration but I see nothing about that

Edit: I filled 5 of the box spreads at $34.20 might do more

Edit 2: It's like the calls are pricing in what the stock is at now, because if they didn't then people could buy underpriced calls and take advantage of it. And the puts are pricing in the stock as if it's at $142.50, with a small risk premium of the deal falling through",3,Am I a genius or a regard? $VMW arbitrage attempt,8.0

2024-01-17,AVGO,"I own XOM at $58, and even at today's 52wk low, it is WAY overpriced! I have no idea who paid $120 for it 3 months ago.

Here is why: XOM 10 years return is 51% with DRIP

Compare that to SCHD which has roughly same yield and has returned 185% with drip, in the same 10 years.

Im not saying XOM is a bad stock .. just not at this price.

And on top of that, if u think there will be recession, oil is likely heading to $50-60... Then so is XOM ... And oil at 50-60 for couple of years, its hard to increase dividends more than 3-4% a year

Basically while i like xom and it did well for me between dividends and covered calls, but  its just way too expensive.

Also, Chevron did much better than Exxon over same 10 years, and oil prices for both were the same... So if you are getting into oil now (which isn't a good time i think) you should really ready their last few annual reports and listen to some earned calls to understand why CVX did so much better than XOM (albeit both did poorly)...

Microsoft and Facebook (NVIDIA's two biggest H100 customers) are also rolling their own.  NVIDIA is smart to get in on this and get dependence on their IP.  Their biggest competition is their own customers.  

I did ASIC design in the past, and the AI algorithms really aren't that complicated compared to say-- designing a modem.  Your talking about some pretty well understood math, some HBM, and replicating the shit out of it and stuffing as much into a box as possible.  The hard part is interfacing and the SW.

2024-02-15,GOOG,"I saw Google and Apple are at decent p/e levels. Not overpriced based on their recent history. 

Today Google dropped because there was a rumor that ChatGPT will release a new search engine based on bing. So the drop in the Google stock seems superficial imo.

At the same time, I used their ai and it’s definitely not as good as ChatGPT… by a long shot. That ceo has been putting a circus show ever since chat gpt came into the picture. From day one that ceo has been on some stage or news outlet stating the wonders of their ai. That means they are definitely nervous about it. 

At the same time imo their ad services are terrible outside of the search results. Any display ad is a joke and every website now is covered by 80% ads and imo this will backfire if a good alternative comes around. 

More and more people are choosing to search answers in Reddit because Google just throws off two pages filled with seo enhanced, top 10 product , ad covered results. Having something with natural language that will totally destroy Google imo. The ceo has been focusing on the wrong way to maximize profits. One example is the vignette ads which are those that appear when you click on a link in a page and there’s a full page ad first you have to hit close to go to the link.
The issue is that the actual ad is way off. If it was something I’d be interested in then cool but it’s totally off showing random products not related to anything about me. Meta in this regard is years ahead. 
So it’s the ai/algo in the back end that’s what’s screwing Google imo. Not to mention all the random things the ceo jumped into as a fad to later crumble. (Stadia). 
That ceo has poor planning and imo most of the revenue comes from the previous services that the nerds before him setup. And by now it’s showing its age thanks to ai. 

Anyways, I do see Google growing either way, but not for long. Unless that ceo gets replaced.",14,Google (GOOG) DCF Analysis,2.0

I don't see how it would help people who are in business of ... really anything. Let's take a scientist who is developing new drugs that is working on a project and need to find information of various sorts. This includes finding contract research organizations with the right compencies, scientific articles, companys working on similar things, shipping companies for samples, contact information of collaborators, university experts, etc. etc.

All of this is based on Search and a vast number of websites with information. Do we really believe that GPT will replace the human interaction/review of this? If it does, then websites are in fact obsolete. If GPT is so great at connecting everything, you would need to build a web-like infrastructure on top of GPT for it to gather the relevant information.

NIH and FDA are involved in their Phase 3 which is being studied as we speak. FDA helped design the P3 studies. NIH has given millions to Cassava Sciences to study this drug. What drives me are colleagues family members in the trial. It’s easy to approach this negatively when you are only reading seeking alpha and op ed pieces. Alzheimer’s is a death sentence and the most heart wrenching disease for family. The cost to the healthcare system is tremendous. As a clinical pharmacist, do you remember when Botulinum toxin was discovered? Probably not because you were not born. Do you remember when Metformin was brought to market? I do. Did you read the trials? We still don’t understand the MOA. The original trials were lackluster. Go back to your pharmacy job and look up the MOA of lithium, Armodafinil (Nuvigil)…. Capaxone.

Alzheimer’s is the holy grail? Less than 2% of the population have Alzheimer’s. If you want, “holy grail,” give me the cure to diabetes. 

Edit: I’m a clinical pharmacist. I reviewed some of the literature on this drug and it looks really weird. The trials are poorly conducted, methods not well explained, and considering this is a chronic disease state, there was very short follow-up. My biggest issue is there is no placebo in the study. Even the basics of trial design aren’t followed. **I can’t even draw positive or negative conclusions from these studies. They mean nothing to me. This is NOT how normal scientific publications are like. And while I said I cannot draw conclusions from this, I do draw very negative conclusions from this because it feels like they are trying to hide something.** The trials gave me a weird vibe… It almost feels like they just wanted to study some old people, quickly conducted the study, disappeared in the dark of the night, and quickly made their publication so no one would ask questions. 

And from a scientific standpoint, I have serious doubts that this drug would be efficacious and even more serious doubts about your claim that there are no negative effects. 

Stop investing in biotech if you don’t even understand medicine and science. And in this case, there’s a severe lack of understanding from investors about anatomy and drug action as well.

2023-09-09,LLY,"Gilead, in 2015, had a blockbuster drug called Harvoni, which cured Hepatitis C.

A few years later, there were competing Hep C treatments that undercut Gilead's six figure pricing, causing sales to go down. Also, this was a treatment drug, so there were repeat patients who they could continuously sell to, unlike their other medications that treat for HIV/AIDS.

Eli Lilly has a better pipeline right now, with their obesity and Alzheimer's drugs, which have a much higher addressable market and they are treating chronic conditions.

2024-03-26,LLY,"Several problems. 
1. People with type 1 diabetes use insulin. Generally people with type 2 use medicine and diet to get their blood sugar under control.

2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that generally happens in children, when the immune system starts attacking the cells that make insulin. There is no cure and insulin treatment is for life. They are in the minority of the two main types of diabetes (there are several types).

3. Type 2 has historically been attributed to eating sugar, but that's not really the case. It's a mix of genetics, diet, and health and sometimes just bad luck. It's when the body doesn't use the insulin it makes correctly which leads to high blood sugar. They generally treat it with pills and diet (ozempic too now). Sometimes if it's really bad they will be treated with insulin, but this is rarely for life. Type 2 makes up the majority of people with diabetes.

There really are only TSMC, Samsung, and Intel left in this game.

Also, semi industry is notoriously cyclical, but if you believe that more and more compute will be needed for our future lives (as most tech bulls do), it's hard to not see FAB companies finding a way to make money through negotiating power, especially when there are so few of them, even if the Capex is huge.

2024-02-19,NVDA,"Why? It's simple math and business dynamic, really.

NVDA valuation is $1.7T. Same as Google, Same as Amazon. More than half of Apple, or Microsoft.

Everyday, I directly use Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft products.

And I pay them good money too, some of it is SW services (GOOG, MSFT), some of it is infra/logictics (AMZN), some of it is HW and services (AAPL).

You could argue that most people buy a new phone every 2-3 years, and a graphics card less often. It's roughly the same cost, and the same margin as a GPU card.

They only sold 30m GPU. Meta, arguably one of the top 3 AI companies using AI at scale, is buying 500k cards. Compare this is with 223m Apple phones being sold (I realize that H100 is much more expensive, Apple is selling more than phones too).

What this means is that it is not the customer being graphic cards, it is business trying to scale their business with AI. But these are businesses. They tend to overact on the upside and downside (over invest, underinvest), see what happened in 2022 and 2023. down, then up. Same businesses, but the valuation dropped by 50-75%, then bounced back by 2-4x.

Businesses need to make some money. Obviously. How much money is being made by AI products? Not much. It is revenue, not profit. It is cap ex and business expenditure, not profit. Many are trying to find product market fit. (OpenAI is the poster child for that). Sure creators are leveraging this quite a bit, but that's a few % of the population, not everyone.

GPU cost is one thing, then you have to pay for the datacenter, electricity, software to develop on it. Rest assured that a lot of effort will be spent to optimize for SW, so the cost is not getting crazy.

SW companies cannot buy 30m GPU cards every year, at some point they will need some sort of ROI. At some point, there will be some companies saying that they have enough GPU cards for the moment. They will say that they don't need to splurge on GPU/AI card as much until they can absorb the current stock they already have.

For price to go up further, it means that NVIDIA will have to improve their margin and sell many more cards. A ton more. And then NVIDIA will be as big as Apple?

The risk profile today is more risk on the downside than on the upside. You just need a bit of some bad news or doubt to trigger a drop. Could NVIDIA bump by 10-25% with the earnings this week, with news of a stock split? Sure. But that will make for a better entry point on the short side.",310,To all the NVDA bears… why?,4.0

Which means if NVDA has a 300% increase in profit over last q, which was a 60% increase in profit over the Q before it, then they are going to make it.

[Post](https://i.imgur.com/NG7EgcT.png):

Alright, fellow degenerates, strap in and grip your tendies tight, because I’m about to take you on a wild ride through the stock market savanna with none other than Grandpa Diamond Hands and his trusty sidekick, Little Timmy. This isn't just any tale. It's the saga of how a boomer with balls of steel and his millennial heir-apparent took on the Nvidia colossus and came out smelling like a rose bathed in YOLO sauce.

#Chapter 1: The Awakening

It all started on a stormy afternoon. Grandpa, a veteran of the dot-com bubble and a survivor of the '08 financial meltdown, decided it was time to pass on his wisdom. Between sips of whiskey and yelling at the TV, he turned to Timmy and said, ""Listen here, you little rascal, the secret to unfathomable wealth isn’t in saving... it's in the art of the YOLO.""

Timmy, whose investment experience was limited to losing money on a videogame retailer, was intrigued. ""But Grandpa,"" he inquired, ""where do we start?""

With a gleam in his eye, Grandpa pulled up a chart of Nvidia. ""Graphics cards, my boy! The world's thirst for these silicon beauties is unquenchable. And with every gamer, crypto miner, and ~~AI researcher~~ horny millennials clamoring for more, it's our ticket to the moon!""

#Chapter 2: The Bet

Armed with nothing but a 100 MB of data and a Robinhood account funded by years of neglected birthday checks, they began their quest. Grandpa, with his ancient wisdom, saw beyond the mere mortals' fear of PE ratios and market corrections. ""To Valhalla!"" he exclaimed, as they went all in on Nvidia calls right before earnings.

The snobs at r / investing laughed. ""Foolish boomers and their millennial minions,"" they sneered, ""they stand no chance. Nvidia is overvalued""

But Grandpa Diamond Hands wasn’t just any investor. He had seen companies rise and fall, fortunes made and lost, all while keeping his hands steadier than a surgeon on Adderall.

#Chapter 3: The Rollercoaster

Earnings day came, and with it, volatility that would make even the most seasoned trader's heart skip a beat. Nvidia’s stock did the cha-cha, sliding down faster than DMs in an Instagram model's inbox, only to rocket up moments later.

Timmy's face was a palette of human emotion, painting a picture of hope, despair, and the kind of intense gastrointestinal discomfort one feels after mixing wendies tendies with Taco Bell.

But Grandpa? Cool as a cumin capered cucumber ""In the stock market, you either ride the wave or get wiped out,"" he said, adjusting his aviator glasses as if he were about to drop the hottest mixtape of 1985.

#Chapter 4: To the Moon

As the dust settled, the impossible happened. Nvidia announced groundbreaking developments, sending their stock soaring higher than Snoop Dogg at a 4/20 festival. Grandpa and Timmy's calls were now worth more than the GDP of a small island nation.

The Wall Street bets crowd went wild. Memes of Grandpa Diamond Hands were plastered all over the internet, hailed as the prophet of profit, the sultan of stocks, the absolute unit of unbridled financial recklessness.

Timmy, now a true believer in the church of YOLO, looked up to his grandfather, tears of joy and visions of Lamborghinis dancing in his eyes. ""What now, Grandpa?"" he asked.

Grandpa, looking off into the sunset, said, ""We do it all over again tomorrow, my boy. For the market giveth, and the market taketh away. But with NASDAQ: NVDA the market mostly just giveth.""

And so, the legend of Grandpa Diamond Hands and his grandson Timmy was born, a tale whispered in the hallowed halls of r/wallstreetbets, inspiring generations of traders to turn their dreams into memes, and their memes into dreams.

Remember, kids, this tale is for entertainment purposes only. Don't try this at home unless you're prepared to live in a shoebox on mainstreet, sucking of bankman friedies for ICO tips. 

And always remember, in the grand casino of the stock market, the house always wins... unless you're Grandpa Diamond Hands. Then you just YOLO your way to Valhalla.

*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. However, for those looking for insane returns, consider the obvious strategy of taking out a second mortgage on your house and YOLO'ing it all on nvidia calls. And now that I think about, if they upload me in to a RTX 9090 I could probably Live More Than Once.*",491,I told my grandson I have 4000 NVDA shares so he'll wipe my ass,8.0

2024-03-07,NVDA,"When talking about a single stock you really have to think what you're asking about and why NVDA's stock price is so high.

* It is very high because recent quarterly earnings have shown a massive increase in demand for NVIDIA's AI chips. 
* Based on this + how much tech is hyping AI-related shit, the Market thinks the demand will only grow.
* All it takes is for the market to get bored and plateau on AI, or for a comparable AI-chip competitor to reign in NVDA's massive profit margin.
* NVDA for now holds a pretty good monopoly on majority of AI chips just by being first to market in a certain way.
* It depends on which future you think is more probable vs your risk vs reward aversion.

It's much more probable the NVDA will drop 20% than VOO will drop 20%, but the upside of NVDA is probably higher than the short-term upside of VOO. So the question is: How much do you care if you lose the money you have in NVDA? If not a lot, you can keep it...

The TL;DR is the last two paragraphs.

""Some years ago I was the adviser to a profit-share trust for a large commodity dealer. I bought for them – I think the stock has been split 15 times since then – a block of Texas Instruments at $14 a share. When the stock got up to $28, the pressure got so strong (“Well, why don’t we sell half of it, so as to get our bait back?”) I had all I could do to hold them until it got to $35. then the same argument: “Phil, sell some of it; we can buy it back when it gets down again.”

That is a totally ridiculous argument. Either this is a better investment than another one or a worse one. Getting your bait back is just a question of psychological comfort. It doesn’t have anything to do with whether it is the right move or not.""",6,Eli Lilly stock hits new 52-week high amid Ozempic study news,3.0

The TAM for their weight loss products is literally something like 2 billion people globally, but their current production only services a tiny proportion of that, and even with competition they have maaaasive headroom for growth.

Their market cap really isn’t that huge, and I could imagine them growing to say an Amazon or Apple sized company from here which also gives them headroom.

It’s an unusual situation but in this case was still a buy for me. Normally I’d shrug and say “missed it”.

I do believe long term it should be pretty safe as you mentioned. The trend the last 100 years is that people are getting fatter and fatter.

Drugs take years (even decades) to develop and go through clinical trials and regulatory approval.

Novo Nordisk did supremely well with Ozempic, but unless it has another killer drug in the pipeline, it’ll fail to justify it’s P/E ratio, especially now as it faces stiff competition from Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro, which (according to all research) is 2x more effective for weight loss with a similar side effect profile. Ozempic still has an advantage over Mounjaro in that it is cheaper, however.

But this really feels like a question of when…

As a couple of tips firstly three months isn't really long enough to understand performance.

2024-02-14,NVO,"It’s not just weight loss.  Obesity has many comorbidities—heart disease, liver and kidney failure, etc.—and Zepbound has the potential to save millions of lives by decreasing those.  But the latest testing shows it doesn’t just make obese people eat less.  Alcoholics drink less; gamblers gamble less. It seems to be a cure for all manner of addictions. This is why Lilly is surging lately; this is a drug that could improve the lives of *billions* of people. And terzepatide appears to be a significant improvement on the older GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic and Trulicity.

Patents prevent competitors from making the same drug; regulations on testing and approval of new drugs make it very expensive for any company to introduce a new drug, even if it’s similar to an existing drug from another manufacturer. So it may be a while before Lilly has competition.

Amgen has a GLP-1/GIP agonist called MariTide in phase 1 testing. It seems promising but is probably a long way from the market.",9,"GLP-1 Weight loss drugs, LLY, NVO, competition ?",9.0

I do think it will be Lily, not Novo, that will produce the ""final iteration"" of these drugs. One that is 1: a pill, not an injection, 2: cheap enough to be covered as preventative care by insurance, and potentially even government subsidized, and 3: more mild in terms of side effects.

2024-03-26,NVO,"Several problems. 
1. People with type 1 diabetes use insulin. Generally people with type 2 use medicine and diet to get their blood sugar under control.

2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that generally happens in children, when the immune system starts attacking the cells that make insulin. There is no cure and insulin treatment is for life. They are in the minority of the two main types of diabetes (there are several types).

3. Type 2 has historically been attributed to eating sugar, but that's not really the case. It's a mix of genetics, diet, and health and sometimes just bad luck. It's when the body doesn't use the insulin it makes correctly which leads to high blood sugar. They generally treat it with pills and diet (ozempic too now). Sometimes if it's really bad they will be treated with insulin, but this is rarely for life. Type 2 makes up the majority of people with diabetes.

Longer-term investment worthiness won't really happen for me until they're closer to a p/e multiple of 10, because positive earnings in the next few years are suspect and I don't feel TSLA engenders the feeling of brand or performance record (for me) that a Google or VW offers.

Tesla could either sell a lot more cars or license that self-driving tech to not only their own car buyers, but to other companies.

Some investors give them HUGE valuation because they think Tesla is way ahead on FSD due to the amount of data they collect.  Of course, that assumes other things are equal, which is rarely the case especially with things as complex as this.

2024-03-14,TSLA,"As someone who was just shopping EVs, I disagree that Tesla is “the gold standard for high quality EVs.”  Based on current offerings they are pretty-good at best but competitors like Hyundai are offering better quality EVs at lower price points, so your competitive analysis is waaaay oversimplified. Fit and finish, visibility when driving, safety / kid-friendly features, and other fundamentals tended to lean away from Tesla in my test drives. 

You’re free to disagree with my test drives, but either way looking at EVs as a two player space makes it really difficult to take the rest of your analysis seriously. 

Tesla does not compete on quality. Tesla completes on being the “tech brand” for people who want to feel cutting edge. Today the feature that might make someone prefer Tesla as a buyer would be the superior charging network, but that’s going to continue to erode over time as other networks expand. Autopilot is a thing but it’s very expensive and I don’t think the auto market at large is ready to pay a premium to be an early adopter. The other reason I could see would be if you just want to say you drive a Tesla. 

One of the reason I’m a long-term bear on Tesla at its current valuation is that I don’t think the company or many of its investors have fully grasped that it’s not 10 years ago and they have real competition now. For as much credit as Tesla deserves for being a first mover, that’s not enough to secure long term profit in the auto industry.",4,Tesla (TSLA) DCF Analysis,1.0
2024-03-14,TSLA,"My point is still that straight-up ignoring other offerings on the market to focus on one competitor makes for a weak analysis.

2024-01-22,TSM,"Well, while I do agree that TSMC will gain value in the long run, the problem with the unrealized pricing potential you see lies IMHO in the following points. 

1. While TSMC holds a lot of prestige in the semiconductor industry as an inovator, today (like every chip foundry under the sun) it relies on ASML tech for lithography.
2. ASML can only churn out so many of their printers per year.
3. Even with ungodly demand for Nvidia chips manufactured by TSMC they can only increase capacity by so much to keep up with demand. 
4. By the time TSMC increases, or is able to increase, production the rest of the world which right now is trying to localize their production of semiconductors, will likely have started their own chip foundries. 

Due to the above, I think TSMC is well priced in, I mean they can come out with some revolutionary process to produce chips faster, but due to the current technological limitations I think that is a bit unlikely, still I would argue that TSMC, ASML and NVDIA are worthy buys if you're looking for a buy and hold strategy.",8,💰Going Long on TSM: The Unseen Goldmine Behind NVDA’s Success💰,4.0
