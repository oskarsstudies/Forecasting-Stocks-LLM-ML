2023-03-28,AAPL,"Strategically speaking, this is smart and ""chump change"".  Apple is one of the few companies with the cash flow to build a streaming business from scratch.

So far, they've been doing a pretty excellent job at it.  Apple TV reminds me of how HBO used to be decades ago.  Very high quality content.  Not a lot of it, but what's there is high quality. 

Now if they can increase the QUANTITY of that high quality, things get interesting and it would be a differentiator from the ""spray and pray"" content at some others.",163,Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,8.0
2023-03-28,AAPL,"I think content creation is really there to add value to their products. 

Netflix has 31.6bn revenue and Apple has 394.3bn revenue.

Chasing the competitive streaming dollars is such a poor use of cash. But driving more product sales and bringing people into the Apple ecosystem is far more profitable.

Netflix would rather sell $1000 devices every 2 years than collecting $7 per month that can be shared by multiple people and cancelled anytime.",109,Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,8.0

But PE ratio is more of when I take a first glance at a company, perhaps earnings is something I should pay attention to especially if I have a high PE ratio but I'm not in the tech industry vice versa.

But, I used to be quite fixated at looking at ratios too when I first started off investing my salary. I guess what changed for me is more of understanding things like Financial Accounting and in general doing more DD, looking at what a company is doing and do I agree with what they believe in.

2024-03-04,AMZN,"This is a great dd, however, i disagree with the conclusion. 

Historically Amazon has spared no expense and reinvested all cashflow in growth.  This is why it maintains such a high pe ratio, people expect it to grow.  But the penny pinching you described has become prevalent.  Why is this a new focus for amazon? Because Jassy has no tricks left in the hat.  Amazon has no more s curve ideas.  So Jassy is racing the lower the P/E ratio because he knows that once the market realizes amazon is not much different from Walmart with a cloud business the valuation will change to match.  

Historically Amazon has massively benefited from first mover advantage and has only dominated in spaces where they started with a strong head start.  (Online retail, alexa, cloud). However they fail massively in spaces where they dont have a lead. (Fire phone, amazon wallet, and a thousand more).  But amazon just missed the boat big time on ai, this should have been the next s curve. Amazon was poised for it.  They have massive amounts of data, engineering talent, and money.  They just flopped.  Imo they have lost their spark, Jassy is not the right guy to lead the business and amazon is entering its balmer era.

I worked in corporate for 3+ years and anyone in corporate will tell you the same.

Ask anyone who works in massive corporations that use a cloud based infrastructure to meet their needs; AWS is KING. They basically ‚Äúrun the internet‚Äù, or a better statement is, ‚Äúthe internet runs on AWS‚Äù. If you‚Äôre lucky enought to know people who have had the luxury of using Google Cloud and Azure, as well as AWS, they will tell you that AWS is miles ahead of anyone. Massive companies don‚Äôt just ‚Äúswitch over‚Äù if they‚Äôre unhappy or looking for something different, either. Which basically means AWS‚Äôs market share will only keep growing. Have you seen their financials? It‚Äôs so incredible that there‚Äôs was rumours that they might ‚Äúsplit‚Äù and have like 2 companies in 1. They generated 91 billion dollars in 2023 alone and it‚Äôs only going to continue to grow. In contrast, if im not mistaken, Azure ‚Äúonly‚Äù made 24 billion. Amazon is literally another 70 billion ahead for the year in revenue. With the expected growth of cloud computing and infrastructure, they‚Äôre poised for a MASSIVE jump in revenue (over 200 billion+ per year) in the next decade-ish. I remember reading that there‚Äôs a possibility for over 300 billion in revenue in the next decade. Of course, like yours, these are all projections, but the numbers are there.

2023-12-03,ASML,"Just my 2 cents.  I sell semiconductors for a living into automotive. ST  is one of those.  My company is a distributor for over 500 semi lines.  ST concerns everyone in automotive.  Especially their high side driver portfolio. Their migration from M07 to M09 has been very slow. Infineon beats them in most sockets based on performance and price.  Their micros aren‚Äôt anything special, NXP, Renesas, Infineon all have equal/better equivalents. 
In regards to the expansion you mention.  Yes during/after Covid they did rapidly expand but maybe too fast.  Right now semis are in a slump.  I am shipping about 60% of what I did in the summer.  All suppliers are having an inventory glut.  They can‚Äôt give away parts in some cases.  ST is not utilizing all their expansion efforts with some sitting idle.  Allocation has really decreased and only a few suppliers are still having issues such as Melexis and Vishay FETs.  I am not saying ST isn‚Äôt a good company but right now semis are tough and I don‚Äôt see ST as a tech leader.  The best suppliers I work with are Monolithic Power, ON and NXP.  So I own them. Just avoid Microchip, they are a cluster fuck at every turn.",40,STMicroelectronics (STM) is one of the best and most undervalued European stocks,3.0
2023-12-03,ASML,"So what‚Äôs the difference to Infineon for example? European tech stocks are usually valued worse than their American equivalent. 
I take it as an advantage that they aren‚Äôt as rich as the American stocks. But STM has an abysmal market share compared to others, but I would say they still have a bright future a head of them. Especially with the EU subsidising everything related to microchips.",32,STMicroelectronics (STM) is one of the best and most undervalued European stocks,7.0
2023-12-03,ASML,"Well that's why I'm highlighting the fact it is mispriced imo. STM has more revenue, better margins, more net income than Infineon. Yet Infineon is currently trading at 15PE, with 47bn market cap on the DAX whereas STM is trading at 9 PE and 39bn market cap. To me it doesn't make sense at all. I think STM has been severely mispriced in recent years, and it continues today even when compared to its direct competitors.

I don't know about your point regarding market share I'll confess, I thought they were doing pretty good and gaining market share recently actually in several areas. I'll see if I can dig up the source.",22,STMicroelectronics (STM) is one of the best and most undervalued European stocks,8.0
2023-12-03,ASML,"I don‚Äôt sell semiconductor but I design with them for a living and NXP processors are not designer/developer friendly. Their application engineering team relative to STmicro is incompetent. We were initially worried but we are glad we moved away from NXPs K24/26 to STML5R4/STMU575 series m. Way more efficient for power sensitive IoT applications and doesn‚Äôt have any unnecessary crap. Fuck NXP.

Edit: OP this guy is a distributor, bigger companies with volume rarely go through a distributor like arrow, mouser, Digikey etc. we directly deal with the manufacturer. We directly bought processors from NXP before and now we directly buy the millions of processors from STmicro. We get reached out by distributors all the time looking for business, we mostly turn them down.

2023-12-03,ASML,"Automotive is definitely in a slump right now.  Automotive is usually the last to see it.  So consumer sees it first then it trickles down to automotive.  In our industry as as whole we see this lasting until Q3 sometime.  This has to do with a lot of things from higher interest rates to inventory surplus.   I have been doing the same thing for 20 years and I am seeing more cancellations now than just about anytime during my tenure, 2008 was a mess though.  I think growth will slow for all semis. Q4 numbers should be telling.  
My viewpoint is mainly from an automotive view. By no means is ST a bad company, my opinion is they don‚Äôt have a technological edge.  Their micros are lacking especially in the ARM space. No real AECQ (automotive qualification) offerings.  Their other highest runner is high side drivers.  Their new family which is M09 technology has been extremely slow to rollout. It‚Äôs behind Infineon, that makes it easier to design in future products if your improved product comes out first.  
A lot of companies grew quickly after  Covid.  It was like someone pushed the On button and immediately suppliers were shipping 100% and beyond capacity.  Leadtimes grew aggressively.  I was quoting Diodes Inc parts at 104 weeks.  
Now it‚Äôs like someone hit the Off button. Lead times are back to normal and I am holding a lot of inventory which will slow all suppliers. 
All large suppliers, ST included, will do better because cars have more and more semi content. When demand does kick back in ST may be positioned to do well because of added capacity.   

I am in the largest automotive market in the world. I can only tell you what I see.  I see better opportunities with other suppliers but I think semis in general is a good place to be going forward.  I don‚Äôt think ST will do poorly but from my standpoint I see better options.  That‚Äôs all.",8,STMicroelectronics (STM) is one of the best and most undervalued European stocks,4.0

2024-01-01,ASML,"Happy new year!   Nice research.  You put in the effort.  I applaud that.  Allow me to give you the perspective of an old IT industry pro. 

That company was the leader 50 years ago and there was no one else for decades.  AMD started by making cheap clones but were ignored by Intel like a flea on an elephant.  For decades they were just printing money.  Intel was ‚Äúinside‚Äù everything.  They just fell asleep at the wheel.  Sorry but you just don‚Äôt come back from that.  Dozens of other companies from that era missed the boat and they are either gone or a shadow of themselves.   

IBM used to be #1 for decades.  Biggest company in the world.  Now a shadow.  DEC was #2 computer company for decades and used to make the most innovative chips and systems in the world.  Many still in use.  Gone.  Purchased by an IBM PC clone maker by the name of Compaq.  Gone.   Purchased by HP.  Now a shadow of themselves. I can speak with some knowledge on the subject as I worked for both DEC and IBM for more years than I want to remember. Yes. Jurassic park here. 

So answer me. Is GM or Ford going to be the leader in EVs and beat Tesla?   Is Yahoo is going to take back the search crown from google?  Is Lotus 123 going to take back dominance in spreadsheets from Microsoft?  If not why would anyone bet on a relic like Intel being in the same league as Nvidia or AMD let alone be the future of chips.  They are the past.  40 years ago‚Ä¶great idea‚Ä¶‚Ä¶2024‚Ä¶.not so much.  

Some things get better with age.  Wine.  Buildings.  Books.  Art.  Cities.  But chip firms aren‚Äôt one of them.  Technology cycles are getting shorter and shorter.  The next Nvidia and AMD is out there.  Go forth and find it young one.  When you do please do me a favor and don‚Äôt tell me because I‚Äôm just too darn old.

Likewise, AMAT, ASML, KLAC, LRCX are the main semiconductor equipment companies.

2023-09-08,AVGO,"I am not an expert on acquisition. I am trying to understand ... So you will receive 79 broadcom shares and 45k in cash. 
Then you are planning to sell 79 AVGO shares around 855$ each (total 67,5k). To make 12k in profit overall. Correct? 
 
Then how do you assume that broadcom share value will remain the same? 
As far as I have read, the acquiring company drops in value during an acquisition, additionally where do all the shares that will be exchanged from VMW to AVGO come from? Will AVGO issue 50 mln shares? 
Wouldn't that dilute the stocks value?

This will be the new deliverable per contract after the merger is done.  The deliverable for adjusted VMW options will be BASED ON THE MERGER CONSIDERATION WHICH ACCRUES TO NON-ELECTING VMW SHAREHOLDERS (stated in terms of a current 100-Share deliverable). 100 x Non-Electing Consideration 

People can elect to take .252 broadcom(currently valued at about $210.54, or $142.50 in cash. And broadcom is only paying 50% cash, 50% shares, so if too many people choose one or the other then it will be prorated. And obviously people will choose the shares so the default non electing consideration will almost 100% be the $142.50 cash and that will be the new deliverable instead of 100 shares.

So this will be the details of the box spread

140 short call - Obligation to deliver $142.50 and receive $140 = $2.50 debit

140 long put - Right to deliver $142.50 and receive $140, not in the money so you won't exercise that.

160 long call - Right to spend $160 to receive $142.50, not in the money so you won't exercise that

160 short put - Obligation to deliver $160 and receive $142.50 - $17.50 debit

You got $30.25 credit and the total debit was $20 so you should have a guaranteed gain of $10.25. But this seems too good to be true and I'm still trying to figure out wtf is going on.

The only thing I can think of at this point for the strange prices is a large dividend before expiration but I see nothing about that

Edit: I filled 5 of the box spreads at $34.20 might do more

Edit 2: It's like the calls are pricing in what the stock is at now, because if they didn't then people could buy underpriced calls and take advantage of it. And the puts are pricing in the stock as if it's at $142.50, with a small risk premium of the deal falling through",3,Am I a genius or a regard? $VMW arbitrage attempt,8.0

2024-01-17,AVGO,"I own XOM at $58, and even at today's 52wk low, it is WAY overpriced! I have no idea who paid $120 for it 3 months ago.

Here is why: XOM 10 years return is 51% with DRIP

Compare that to SCHD which has roughly same yield and has returned 185% with drip, in the same 10 years.

Im not saying XOM is a bad stock .. just not at this price.

And on top of that, if u think there will be recession, oil is likely heading to $50-60... Then so is XOM ... And oil at 50-60 for couple of years, its hard to increase dividends more than 3-4% a year

Basically while i like xom and it did well for me between dividends and covered calls, but  its just way too expensive.

Also, Chevron did much better than Exxon over same 10 years, and oil prices for both were the same... So if you are getting into oil now (which isn't a good time i think) you should really ready their last few annual reports and listen to some earned calls to understand why CVX did so much better than XOM (albeit both did poorly)...

2024-02-15,GOOG,"I saw Google and Apple are at decent p/e levels. Not overpriced based on their recent history. 

Today Google dropped because there was a rumor that ChatGPT will release a new search engine based on bing. So the drop in the Google stock seems superficial imo.

At the same time, I used their ai and it‚Äôs definitely not as good as ChatGPT‚Ä¶ by a long shot. That ceo has been putting a circus show ever since chat gpt came into the picture. From day one that ceo has been on some stage or news outlet stating the wonders of their ai. That means they are definitely nervous about it. 

At the same time imo their ad services are terrible outside of the search results. Any display ad is a joke and every website now is covered by 80% ads and imo this will backfire if a good alternative comes around. 

More and more people are choosing to search answers in Reddit because Google just throws off two pages filled with seo enhanced, top 10 product , ad covered results. Having something with natural language that will totally destroy Google imo. The ceo has been focusing on the wrong way to maximize profits. One example is the vignette ads which are those that appear when you click on a link in a page and there‚Äôs a full page ad first you have to hit close to go to the link.
The issue is that the actual ad is way off. If it was something I‚Äôd be interested in then cool but it‚Äôs totally off showing random products not related to anything about me. Meta in this regard is years ahead. 
So it‚Äôs the ai/algo in the back end that‚Äôs what‚Äôs screwing Google imo. Not to mention all the random things the ceo jumped into as a fad to later crumble. (Stadia). 
That ceo has poor planning and imo most of the revenue comes from the previous services that the nerds before him setup. And by now it‚Äôs showing its age thanks to ai.

I don't see how it would help people who are in business of ... really anything.

This includes finding contract research organizations with the right compencies, scientific articles, companys working on similar things, shipping companies for samples, contact information of collaborators, university experts, etc. etc.

All of this is based on Search and a vast number of websites with information. Do we really believe that GPT will replace the human interaction/review of this? If it does, then websites are in fact obsolete. If GPT is so great at connecting everything, you would need to build a web-like infrastructure on top of GPT for it to gather the relevant information.

2024-03-26,LLY,"Several problems. 
1. People with type 1 diabetes use insulin. Generally people with type 2 use medicine and diet to get their blood sugar under control.

2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that generally happens in children, when the immune system starts attacking the cells that make insulin. There is no cure and insulin treatment is for life. They are in the minority of the two main types of diabetes (there are several types).

3. Type 2 has historically been attributed to eating sugar, but that's not really the case. It's a mix of genetics, diet, and health and sometimes just bad luck. It's when the body doesn't use the insulin it makes correctly which leads to high blood sugar. They generally treat it with pills and diet (ozempic too now). Sometimes if it's really bad they will be treated with insulin, but this is rarely for life. Type 2 makes up the majority of people with diabetes.

Instead of talking about the financials, they talked AI this, and AI that. It is all great because according to the media, we just discovered machine learning 3 months ago.

Good companies are not good at every price. If someone doesn't understand this, look up TXN, MSFT, and KO stocks performance over the last 30 years and their multiple expansion and contraction",12,This is why I held and kept buying Nvidia (NVDA),2.0

2023-11-27,NVDA,"There has been immense consolidation among the FAB companies, because as you note the capex necessary is increasingly significantly... that said, if TSMC (and possibly samsung from a wider war where waterways/airways are dangerous) are hindred, then INTC has a ton of negotiating power with the fabless design companies.  There really are only TSMC, Samsung, and Intel left in this game.

Also, semi industry is notoriously cyclical, but if you believe that more and more compute will be needed for our future lives (as most tech bulls do), it's hard to not see FAB companies finding a way to make money through negotiating power, especially when there are so few of them, even if the Capex is huge.

2024-02-19,NVDA,"Why? It's simple math and business dynamic, really.

NVDA valuation is $1.7T. Same as Google, Same as Amazon. More than half of Apple, or Microsoft.

Everyday, I directly use Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft products.

And I pay them good money too, some of it is SW services (GOOG, MSFT), some of it is infra/logictics (AMZN), some of it is HW and services (AAPL).

You could argue that most people buy a new phone every 2-3 years, and a graphics card less often. It's roughly the same cost, and the same margin as a GPU card.

They only sold 30m GPU. Meta, arguably one of the top 3 AI companies using AI at scale, is buying 500k cards. Compare this is with 223m Apple phones being sold (I realize that H100 is much more expensive, Apple is selling more than phones too).

What this means is that it is not the customer being graphic cards, it is business trying to scale their business with AI. But these are businesses. They tend to overact on the upside and downside (over invest, underinvest), see what happened in 2022 and 2023. down, then up. Same businesses, but the valuation dropped by 50-75%, then bounced back by 2-4x.

Businesses need to make some money. Obviously. How much money is being made by AI products? Not much. It is revenue, not profit. It is cap ex and business expenditure, not profit. Many are trying to find product market fit. (OpenAI is the poster child for that). Sure creators are leveraging this quite a bit, but that's a few % of the population, not everyone.

GPU cost is one thing, then you have to pay for the datacenter, electricity, software to develop on it. Rest assured that a lot of effort will be spent to optimize for SW, so the cost is not getting crazy.

SW companies cannot buy 30m GPU cards every year, at some point they will need some sort of ROI. At some point, there will be some companies saying that they have enough GPU cards for the moment. They will say that they don't need to splurge on GPU/AI card as much until they can absorb the current stock they already have.

For price to go up further, it means that NVIDIA will have to improve their margin and sell many more cards. A ton more. And then NVIDIA will be as big as Apple?

The risk profile today is more risk on the downside than on the upside. You just need a bit of some bad news or doubt to trigger a drop. Could NVIDIA bump by 10-25% with the earnings this week, with news of a stock split? Sure. But that will make for a better entry point on the short side.",310,To all the NVDA bears‚Ä¶ why?,4.0

[Post](https://i.imgur.com/NG7EgcT.png):

Alright, fellow degenerates, strap in and grip your tendies tight, because I‚Äôm about to take you on a wild ride through the stock market savanna with none other than Grandpa Diamond Hands and his trusty sidekick, Little Timmy. This isn't just any tale. It's the saga of how a boomer with balls of steel and his millennial heir-apparent took on the Nvidia colossus and came out smelling like a rose bathed in YOLO sauce.

#Chapter 1: The Awakening

It all started on a stormy afternoon. Grandpa, a veteran of the dot-com bubble and a survivor of the '08 financial meltdown, decided it was time to pass on his wisdom. Between sips of whiskey and yelling at the TV, he turned to Timmy and said, ""Listen here, you little rascal, the secret to unfathomable wealth isn‚Äôt in saving... it's in the art of the YOLO.""

Timmy, whose investment experience was limited to losing money on a videogame retailer, was intrigued. ""But Grandpa,"" he inquired, ""where do we start?""

With a gleam in his eye, Grandpa pulled up a chart of Nvidia. ""Graphics cards, my boy! The world's thirst for these silicon beauties is unquenchable. And with every gamer, crypto miner, and ~~AI researcher~~ horny millennials clamoring for more, it's our ticket to the moon!""

#Chapter 2: The Bet

Armed with nothing but a 100 MB of data and a Robinhood account funded by years of neglected birthday checks, they began their quest. Grandpa, with his ancient wisdom, saw beyond the mere mortals' fear of PE ratios and market corrections. ""To Valhalla!"" he exclaimed, as they went all in on Nvidia calls right before earnings.

The snobs at r / investing laughed. ""Foolish boomers and their millennial minions,"" they sneered, ""they stand no chance. Nvidia is overvalued""

But Grandpa Diamond Hands wasn‚Äôt just any investor. He had seen companies rise and fall, fortunes made and lost, all while keeping his hands steadier than a surgeon on Adderall.

#Chapter 3: The Rollercoaster

Earnings day came, and with it, volatility that would make even the most seasoned trader's heart skip a beat. Nvidia‚Äôs stock did the cha-cha, sliding down faster than DMs in an Instagram model's inbox, only to rocket up moments later.

Timmy's face was a palette of human emotion, painting a picture of hope, despair, and the kind of intense gastrointestinal discomfort one feels after mixing wendies tendies with Taco Bell.

But Grandpa? Cool as a cumin capered cucumber ""In the stock market, you either ride the wave or get wiped out,"" he said, adjusting his aviator glasses as if he were about to drop the hottest mixtape of 1985.

#Chapter 4: To the Moon

As the dust settled, the impossible happened. Nvidia announced groundbreaking developments, sending their stock soaring higher than Snoop Dogg at a 4/20 festival. Grandpa and Timmy's calls were now worth more than the GDP of a small island nation.

The Wall Street bets crowd went wild. Memes of Grandpa Diamond Hands were plastered all over the internet, hailed as the prophet of profit, the sultan of stocks, the absolute unit of unbridled financial recklessness.

Timmy, now a true believer in the church of YOLO, looked up to his grandfather, tears of joy and visions of Lamborghinis dancing in his eyes. ""What now, Grandpa?"" he asked.

Grandpa, looking off into the sunset, said, ""We do it all over again tomorrow, my boy. For the market giveth, and the market taketh away. But with NASDAQ: NVDA the market mostly just giveth.""

And so, the legend of Grandpa Diamond Hands and his grandson Timmy was born, a tale whispered in the hallowed halls of r/wallstreetbets, inspiring generations of traders to turn their dreams into memes, and their memes into dreams.

Remember, kids, this tale is for entertainment purposes only. Don't try this at home unless you're prepared to live in a shoebox on mainstreet, sucking of bankman friedies for ICO tips. 

And always remember, in the grand casino of the stock market, the house always wins... unless you're Grandpa Diamond Hands. Then you just YOLO your way to Valhalla.

*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. However, for those looking for insane returns, consider the obvious strategy of taking out a second mortgage on your house and YOLO'ing it all on nvidia calls. And now that I think about, if they upload me in to a RTX 9090 I could probably Live More Than Once.*",491,I told my grandson I have 4000 NVDA shares so he'll wipe my ass,8.0

* It is very high because recent quarterly earnings have shown a massive increase in demand for NVIDIA's AI chips. 
* Based on this + how much tech is hyping AI-related shit, the Market thinks the demand will only grow.
* All it takes is for the market to get bored and plateau on AI, or for a comparable AI-chip competitor to reign in NVDA's massive profit margin.
* NVDA for now holds a pretty good monopoly on majority of AI chips just by being first to market in a certain way.
* It depends on which future you think is more probable vs your risk vs reward aversion.

The TL;DR is the last two paragraphs.

""Some years ago I was the adviser to a profit-share trust for a large commodity dealer. I bought for them ‚Äì I think the stock has been split 15 times since then ‚Äì a block of Texas Instruments at $14 a share. When the stock got up to $28, the pressure got so strong (‚ÄúWell, why don‚Äôt we sell half of it, so as to get our bait back?‚Äù) I had all I could do to hold them until it got to $35. then the same argument: ‚ÄúPhil, sell some of it; we can buy it back when it gets down again.‚Äù

That is a totally ridiculous argument. Either this is a better investment than another one or a worse one. Getting your bait back is just a question of psychological comfort.

The TAM for their weight loss products is literally something like 2 billion people globally, but their current production only services a tiny proportion of that, and even with competition they have maaaasive headroom for growth.

Their market cap really isn‚Äôt that huge, and I could imagine them growing to say an Amazon or Apple sized company from here which also gives them headroom.

It‚Äôs an unusual situation but in this case was still a buy for me. Normally I‚Äôd shrug and say ‚Äúmissed it‚Äù.

I do believe long term it should be pretty safe as you mentioned. The trend the last 100 years is that people are getting fatter and fatter.

As a couple of tips firstly three months isn't really long enough to understand performance.

1. People with type 1 diabetes use insulin. Generally people with type 2 use medicine and diet to get their blood sugar under control.

2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that generally happens in children, when the immune system starts attacking the cells that make insulin. There is no cure and insulin treatment is for life. They are in the minority of the two main types of diabetes (there are several types).

3. Type 2 has historically been attributed to eating sugar, but that's not really the case. It's a mix of genetics, diet, and health and sometimes just bad luck. It's when the body doesn't use the insulin it makes correctly which leads to high blood sugar. They generally treat it with pills and diet (ozempic too now). Sometimes if it's really bad they will be treated with insulin, but this is rarely for life. Type 2 makes up the majority of people with diabetes.

2023-10-29,TSLA,"The problem is that the biggest part of their potential future valuation is for parts of the business that barely exists right now: *actual* full self-driving and the business opportunities that opens up both as personal taxis, shared personally-owned taxis, and for companies like Uber and Lyft.  Tesla could either sell a lot more cars or license that self-driving tech to not only their own car buyers, but to other companies.

Some investors give them HUGE valuation because they think Tesla is way ahead on FSD due to the amount of data they collect.  Of course, that assumes other things are equal, which is rarely the case especially with things as complex as this.  IMO Tesla will not gain much if any actual advantage with FSD long-term, and so they essentially are primarily a car company and as such are vastly overvalued.",50,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),4.0

2024-03-14,TSLA,"As someone who was just shopping EVs, I disagree that Tesla is ‚Äúthe gold standard for high quality EVs.‚Äù  Based on current offerings they are pretty-good at best but competitors like Hyundai are offering better quality EVs at lower price points, so your competitive analysis is waaaay oversimplified. Fit and finish, visibility when driving, safety / kid-friendly features, and other fundamentals tended to lean away from Tesla in my test drives. 

You‚Äôre free to disagree with my test drives, but either way looking at EVs as a two player space makes it really difficult to take the rest of your analysis seriously. 

Tesla does not compete on quality. Tesla completes on being the ‚Äútech brand‚Äù for people who want to feel cutting edge. Today the feature that might make someone prefer Tesla as a buyer would be the superior charging network, but that‚Äôs going to continue to erode over time as other networks expand. Autopilot is a thing but it‚Äôs very expensive and I don‚Äôt think the auto market at large is ready to pay a premium to be an early adopter. The other reason I could see would be if you just want to say you drive a Tesla. 

One of the reason I‚Äôm a long-term bear on Tesla at its current valuation is that I don‚Äôt think the company or many of its investors have fully grasped that it‚Äôs not 10 years ago and they have real competition now.

2024-01-22,TSM,"Well, while I do agree that TSMC will gain value in the long run, the problem with the unrealized pricing potential you see lies IMHO in the following points. 

1. While TSMC holds a lot of prestige in the semiconductor industry as an inovator, today (like every chip foundry under the sun) it relies on ASML tech for lithography.
2. ASML can only churn out so many of their printers per year.
3. Even with ungodly demand for Nvidia chips manufactured by TSMC they can only increase capacity by so much to keep up with demand. 
4. By the time TSMC increases, or is able to increase, production the rest of the world which right now is trying to localize their production of semiconductors, will likely have started their own chip foundries. 

Due to the above, I think TSMC is well priced in, I mean they can come out with some revolutionary process to produce chips faster, but due to the current technological limitations I think that is a bit unlikely, still I would argue that TSMC, ASML and NVDIA are worthy buys if you're looking for a buy and hold strategy.",8,üí∞Going Long on TSM: The Unseen Goldmine Behind NVDA‚Äôs Successüí∞,4.0

Then move your start date another month and run it again.  And again, and again, and you'll just get a different answer every time.   

All that said, I would bet good money that you'll find a way to come to your conclusion no matter what the graphs show, because you're looking for evidence of your conclusion not looking for a conclusion from evidence.",12,PE ratio is a SHITTY way to evaluate how good a company is (DD Analysis),2.0

2024-04-04,XOM,">>Pioneer shareholders will receive 2.3234 shares of ExxonMobil for each Pioneer share at closing

This is why. The deal was all stock, so PXD shares should be trading around 2.32x XOM shares and will go up and down with XOM stock. PXD holders won't receive cash, just stock in XOM.",165,"Exxon purchases Pioneer for $253 per share, but Pioneer is trading at $269",7.0
2024-04-04,XOM,"It is risk to close but also expected return on time and in this case, risk of XOM moving up and down before close.

Like for a hypothetical all cash deal, even if the risk of not closing was 0%... if the actual closing date was unknown or if it was known but say 3 months out, then the price would be discounted (approximately by the risk free return rate for 3 months)",43,"Exxon purchases Pioneer for $253 per share, but Pioneer is trading at $269",3.0
2024-04-04,XOM,"So, the deal is 2.3234 shares of XOM for every share of PXD.

XOM is trading at $119.35, thus the PXD should be trading at $277. but it's trading at $269.  Why is there a 3% difference?  Is it Risk for the deal to close?  Is there some sort of arbitrage opportunity here?

Also, best I can tell  this acq will close sometime in 2Q,  is there any definite date?",19,"Exxon purchases Pioneer for $253 per share, but Pioneer is trading at $269",3.0

2024-04-04,XOM,"It's less to do with XOM's own moves, because you can go short XOM against it. It's risk of the deal falling through that's the big component of the discount.",3,"Exxon purchases Pioneer for $253 per share, but Pioneer is trading at $269",4.0

If I don't do anything, will one day my PXD stock just automatically transform into shares of Exxon in my stock brokerage (Robinhood don't taze me bro)?
